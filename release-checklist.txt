
These are notes for the software author, to help ensure you don't get a broken release :)

= Before =
	* Feature branches are merged to release branch
	* Current revision is tested and working locally
	* New documentation is written

= Release Steps =

If any step fails, fix before continuing, repeating any necessary prior steps.

	1. Check version in package.json, `yarn update-version`, commit if necessary.
	1. Edit WP readme.txt (remember stable tag, tested version, and changelog!)
	1. Update the language template if the release contains new language strings `yarn makepot`, `git commit`;
	1. Merge `git checkout master; git merge --no-ff <dev-branch>`
	1. Make sure tests still pass `composer test`.
    1. For major versions generate and deploy any new PHPDoc and JavaDocs. `yarn jsdoc`, `yarn phpdoc`.
    1. Push master to deploy `git push master`.
	1. Prune issues.
